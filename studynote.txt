Typescript: superset of Javascript, has all the same feature as Javascript 
			but with an additional layer on the top: the type system
			It allows for optional static typing, as well as type inference.
			
			Since Javascript has weekness in static typing, 
			it results harder to spot issues at complie time and leading to hard-to-debug error at runtime.
			As the size of a project increases, the maintainability and readability of the code reduces as well.
			
			Typescript has extra layer on top of Javascript, uses a transpiler at build time to convert the Typescript
			code into Javascript.
			
Static coding: 	Analysis inspect code before/without running it. FInd the structure issues and errors.
				Immediate feedback coding quality and early security check.
Dynamic coding: Analysis tests the running application to see real-time behavior, etc.
				Validate functionality, performance, and security in a live environment.
				

import express  from "express";
import { Express } from "express";

Difference: Express -> type and express -> function.
			Express used only at compile time, express used at runtime**
